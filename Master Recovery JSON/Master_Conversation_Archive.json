Does that align with any of your options presented? That is why we need a volume dedicated specifically to mechanics, and why I want to injest as much 5e for us not to have to go outside to refernece live unless we need to. In my mind that is much faster. what do you think?"

I can create new marker types, NPCs for example, right now the \"NPC\"s are listed as \"encounters\" but I can add any type of marker I want I can also put unicode in (which i dont know how to do but I'll figure it out I suppose). I can also add text and images for the markers. and record details about them in a text editor. I can change the color, shape, and icons for the marker. Not necessarily asking you to do anything different unless you can glean any improvements from this. The only thing i can think of is to perhaps include the images for the NPCs and locations and artifacts we discover in the Json and have them display in the text file attached to each marker. I was able to do this by just pasting a new image into a marker and seeing it update live. Is there a way we can make it generate an image in the text window via code in the JSON i can copy into the text file? or is it something i should do manually."

I can also add text and images for the markers. and record details about them in a text editor. I can change the color, shape, and icons for the marker. Not necessarily asking you to do anything different unless you can glean any improvements from this. The only thing i can think of is to perhaps include the images for the NPCs and locations and artifacts we discover in the Json and have them display in the text file attached to each marker. I was able to do this by just pasting a new image into a marker and seeing it update live. Is there a way we can make it generate an image in the text window via code in the JSON i can copy into the text file? or is it something i should do manually."

                    "content": "So this is what I\u2019m thinking. Normally, I am just sharing my screen through OBS with the players which has worked fine for the most part and will work even better with our new system. Our new lightweight system my thought is, in this interface that we\u2019re building this web interface that we\u2019re building Should we add a refresh scene button so that I can trigger the next scene by just clicking the button and having control over whether the audio is playing or not; because at least this method of the way I\u2019ll be using the web interface will allow me to control what the players are looking at. In OBS Particularly with stream deck integration I can switch between what windows I\u2019m sharing the way I normally have it configured is I isolate the image generation part of ChatGPT so that the players can only see the images you\u2019re generating they can\u2019t see the chat between us because I have it cropped to only show the image. I would do something similar with this web interface at least the version of which I\u2019m controlling. As we develop this further, I can see the players and I are sharing a web interface together, but in order to keep the entire group on the same page so to speak, I would want to control what they see, and when from a management point of view. Unless we have some sort of shared live web experience, the way I am doing it is through sharing different windows, using OBS and stream deck and discord. So right now I have stream deck programmed to switch scenes in OBS. Those scenes are assigned to different windows, e.g. the browser cropped from ChatGPT and another scene for the browser cropped for the web experience that we\u2019re building now potentially. I will have to test this live but what I\u2019m doing with OBS is I\u2019m pulling up a window preview of what is currently being shared in OBS ensuring that through discord. I also need to add the audio sources to OBS to leave appropriate scenes so that the users are also hearing what I\u2019m sharing when I switch scenes. I have not tested this. This is how with my limited understanding. I\u2019m envisioning it work currently if we were to develop some shared experience and I would obviously streamline it if I could. But I\u2019d like to know is number one how will we dynamically change scenes through the web interface Using either repository images and sounds or images that you generate mixed with repository sounds depending on what\u2019s going on live; is this in our plan as you see it? Or with this web interface would we only be limited to whatever is in the repositories. I\u2019m trying to unpack this all in my mind and how we should approach it. Please let me know if you understand and set me straight if I\u2019m on the right path the wrong path or if there are things I\u2019m not thinking of."

Some things I was thinking of is it possible/viable that when a scene is loaded, there can be a begin scene button; let me elaborate here; as well as multiple buttons for repository sounds or live generated sounds or effect; for example portal scene loads hit, begin scene ambient sound begins then, based on the other things occurring in the scene buttons are also preloaded onto the page to trigger a wolf howling nearby, another button for lightning, strike, another button for an arrow whacking by. So practically the page loads, the players see the visual I activate the scene. The first ambient sound begins. I begin the narrative quote you approach the portal. You hear it humming with arcane magic, you hear a wolf howl in the distance brackets I press the Howell button brackets just then an arrow Gueules by your head brackets I press the arrow button brackets. Is it possible to have all of the sounds playing at once. I don\u2019t necessarily want the sounds to stop or interrupt each other. If this is too complicated, we can perhaps just do ambient sounds or music during scenes and I can use the stream deck for other. Sounds like Foley. I would still expect you to provide all of the visual triggers for me in the chat and perhaps in the Webb interface and buttons for the sounds should they be available? It would still provide a back up and an indication for me to either trigger the sounds via the web or face or Those types of sounds via the stream deck. It also made me think of something else. If you are aware of the exact layout of my stream deck, could we come up with some kind of grid some kind of quick reference we\u2019re all of the buttons are numbered perhaps And you tell me in what sequence I need to press them to both navigate to the right pages and hit the right sounds. Sorry if I\u2019m throwing a lot at you this is just a stream of consciousness how I always do things so I don\u2019t forget them when they are popping into my head."
